This repository contains the code for a tech internship platform developed using Java and Spring Boot. The platform aims to connect interns with companies offering internship opportunities in the tech industry.

Technologies and Frameworks Used
The project utilizes the following technologies and frameworks:

* Java: The code is written in Java, a widely used programming language for developing enterprise applications.
Spring Framework: The project leverages the Spring Framework, which provides a comprehensive platform for building Java applications. It includes modules such as Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Spring MVC.
* Jakarta Persistence (JPA): The code uses Jakarta Persistence annotations for mapping Java objects to relational database tables and performing database operations.
* Hibernate: Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java. It is likely being used by the Spring Data JPA module to interact with the database.
* Lombok: Lombok is a Java library used to reduce boilerplate code. It automatically generates getter, setter, constructor, and other commonly used methods based on annotations.
* Spring Boot: Spring Boot simplifies the configuration and deployment of Spring-based applications. It provides defaults for various configurations, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic.
* Spring Data JPA: Spring Data JPA is a part of the Spring Data project that simplifies the implementation of JPA repositories. It provides generic CRUD operations and allows for the creation of custom queries.
* Jakarta Persistence API: Jakarta Persistence is a specification that defines an API for object-relational mapping and database access in Java EE and Jakarta EE applications.

# Design Pattern:
The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The structure of the code suggests the use of the following components:

* Models: The models package contains entity classes representing the core data models of the application.
* Controllers: The controllers package handles HTTP requests and defines the application's endpoints.
* Services: The services package provides business logic and acts as the bridge between models and controllers.
The utilization of the MVC pattern allows for a separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
